# CustomItems Wiki

This branch of the mod is a static wiki that intends to teach how to use of the mod Custom Items

## Helping

If you find something wrong on the wiki, create an issue or help the mod by fixing it. 

## How the wiki works

All the wiki is created using html and markdown alongside with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
I also use [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for design.
