title: Custom Configuration Files
---

Before you start off making your own config files, I recommend using the
following template to get you started and familiar with how the
configurations work. ***[ The config template is on this
page.](https://github.com/0tho/CustomItems/blob/master/configs/tests/all_blank.json)*** You could also use the default
config files when you set restore default config to true in CI's .cfg
file. By default it is set to false. CI has a .cfg file for general
configurations.

All files for CI should be saved as *`.json`*
file in
*`"minecraftInstance/config/customItems"`* Any
text editor can be used to make .json file, so long as you put it after
the name of the file. The mod allows multiple configuration files so can
group custom items instead of having a long list. The file name is not
used in the name, merely for you to know what custom items are where.
